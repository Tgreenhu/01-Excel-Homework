# 01-Excel-Homework

In this assignment, we were presented with a data set from various Kickstarter campaigns.  The data includes name, descriptions, money raised goals, how much was actually pledged, dates active, and the status of the campaign.

Using Excel formulas, I:
    - Conditionally formatted cells into color codes by text
    - Split cells of data into two parts
    - Found averages and percentages of successful/unsuccessful campaigns
    - Converted timestamps into normal dates

From this data, I created multiple pivot charts and graphs to further identify trends and occurrences that I can use to summarize the data.  Each of these are easily filterable by category, sub-category, state of campaign, and more.
    - Campaign Success per Category
    - Campaign Success per Sub-Category
    - Success by Month/Year

Furthermore, I used the formula COUNTIFS to create a pivot table to separate campaign success by goal amount.  From this I calculated the total for each state of campaigns as well as percentages for each.  This is all then shown on a line chart to show a pattern of success rate vs goal amount.

Finally, by using statistical metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance, I created a chart that shows the variability of every possible state of a campaign when using the number of donors per campaign.  This table helps us see if there is an easily identifiable trend, or if there is a wide variance to how many people backed a successful or unsuccessful campaign.
